# React Add User List App

## Overview
This is a simple React application that allows users to add names and ages dynamically to a list. If the user enters an empty input or an age less than 0, a modal will appear to inform the user and prompt them to provide valid information. The app then dynamically displays the list of added users with their names and ages.
